- All the code is in the “qxia7490_COMP5406_AS2_sent.ipynb” file. 

- Make sure the model files are in the same directory as the code file

- Open the file, we can see the code are been divided into sections which has the same order as mentioned in the assignment specifications. 

- Each code cell is annotated, and the execution order is from Section 1 -> Section 2 -> Section 3
	- Section 1 is for download data files, data wrangling, generate vocabulary, 
	vectorizing document and question data, and visualizing the document length 	
	distribution

	- Section 2.1 is for word embedding, four feature extraction

	- Section 2.2 is for Bi-LSTM with attention model

	- Section 2.3 is for testing the precision, recall, F-score of the model

NOTE: Each code cell in the sections are annotated with their use and purpose
